# Basics #

Welcome to the help section of PoESkillTree. We will start by going over how to use the basic functions.

## Load Skill tree from URL ##

You want to load the Sill tree of a cool build some one else have done? Or maybe your own from somewhere else? This is how you do it:

* Paste the URL in the **Skill tree link** box and press **Enter** or click **Load Tree** button, and that's it.

## Create Build ##

Lets create a build from scratch!

1. Choose **Class** from dropdown.
2. Set **Level** (this will affect your attributes).
3. Start adding nodes you want.
4. When done, save your build:
   * Pressing **CTRL+S**
   * From Menu: **File** -> **Save As**
   * Open the **Saved Builds** panel and click **Save As**

## Load Saved Build ##

To load a saved build open the **Saved Builds** panel and  double-click on the build you want to load.

## Save Modified Build ##

If you did changes to an already saved build or just want to replace one,
select the desired build and click **Save**.
You can also change the name/note on a build by right-clicking it.

**(Advanced)** In this window you can also inspect,
change and remove item data, keep in mind that it is raw data so only change if
you know what you are doing.

# Items and Gems #

Now that you have a nice Skill tree, it is time to add some items and gems to calculate your DPS and defences.

*This feature require you to download data from pathofexile.com!*

## Setup character ##

To get item and gem data we are going to access one of your characters from pathofexile.com.
This character needs be equiped with the items and gems that you want for your build, so head over
to the client and fix that.
