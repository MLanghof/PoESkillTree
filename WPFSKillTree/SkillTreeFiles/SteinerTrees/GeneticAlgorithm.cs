        /// This genetic algorithm involves the standard two operations (mutation
        /// and crossover) performed on the DNA of the individuals comprised by
        /// the population, with a few twists.
        /// 
        /// Currently, a few things have been altered from standard procedures:
        ///  1. Half the population (the lower fitness half) is culled from the
        ///     pool every generation. New members are generated from the DNA
        ///     crossover (this part is still fairly standard, the choice of "half"
        ///     the population is arbitrary though).
        ///     Any surviving member is undergoes 3.
        ///  2. An individual must have survived a previous round of culling to
        ///     procreate via crossover. This seems to significantly improve the
        ///     quality of the crossover'd solutions without affecting genetic
        ///     diversity.
        ///  3. Mutations can be rejected:
        ///     The DNA is mutated (a single bit is flipped) and always accepted
        ///     if it results in a higher fitness value, otherwise the mutation is
        ///     discarded if a random roll (hardened by a higher fitness difference)
        ///     fails.
        ///     
        /// The first alteration ensures that the evolutionary pressure is kept on,
        /// in order to ensure a good pace of search progress.
        /// 
        /// The second one, as mentioned above, significantly reduces the amount of
        /// low fitness (therefore immediately discarded) DNA introduced from cross-
        /// overs.
        /// 
        /// The chance to reject inferior mutations is borrowed from the concept
        /// of simulated annealing. Generally a lot of potential steiner nodes
        /// are just far off and will never contribute to a better solution, so
        /// doing this "sanity" check helps keeping the dna quality in the pool high.
        /// 
        /// 
        /// For the actual crossover, two DNA "parents" are chosen at random (each
        /// via a random sample from "mature" individuals), with each individual's
        /// chance being proportional to its fitness. More precisely, fitness values
        /// are normalized to the 0-1 range (based on the so far observed max and
        /// min fitness) and used as the respective individual's weight in the
        /// random sampling. This ensures that the crossover in general is quite
        /// agnostic to the absolute values of the fitness function and therefore
        /// works similarly for all inputs.
