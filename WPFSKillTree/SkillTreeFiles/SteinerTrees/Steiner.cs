        /// This code is a heuristic solution to the Steiner tree problem (STP).
        /// (The reader's knowledge of the STP and commonly associated terms is
        /// assumed.)
        /// 
        /// The main code logic is found in these classes:
        ///  - SteinerSolver:
        ///         Handles all model knowledge and converts between the SkillNode
        ///         and preprocessed GraphNode tree versions. Also defines the fit-
        ///         ness function used in the genetic algorithm.
        ///  - GeneticAlgorithm:
        ///         The actual optimization "engine". It searches an n-dimensional
        ///         binary search space (bitstrings of length n) for an argument
        ///         that maximizes the value of the provided fitness function.
        /// 
        /// 
        /// Model and solution idea:
        ///   Every steiner tree can be described by its used steiner nodes (plus
        ///   the set of target nodes). Conversion back to a tree is possible by
        ///   building the minimal spanning tree (MST) of those (combined) point
        ///   sets. (The resulting tree may be different, but will have the same
        ///   total weight, which is all we care about).
        ///   Since the problem is to find a minimum weight steiner tree with fixed
        ///   target nodes, the search can be restricted to the space of all pos-
        ///   sible steiner node sets: A steiner node is either included or not in-
        ///   cluded in a particular solution, the search space is thus binary with
        ///   a dimension equal to the amount of potential steiner nodes under 
        ///   consideration.
        ///   
        ///   The actual implementation preprocesses the skill tree graph into an
        ///   alternate representation in order to reduce the search space size
        ///   (and improve pathfinding speed).
        ///   To clarify: "skill node" and "skill tree" will refer to the represen-
        ///   tation used in the main view (SkillNode, SkillTree), while "graph
        ///   nodes" and "graph" will refer to this processed, reduced version that
        ///   is used in most parts of this code (GraphNode, SearchGraph & similar).
        ///

        /// Description of the main algorithm:
        ///  0. The input received is the set of target points that shall be reached
        ///     by a connected graph, a subset of the skill tree net (as found by
        ///     examining the static SkillNodes dictionary in SkillTree). A SkillTree
        ///     instance is also passed to find the currently skilled nodes (and for
        ///     debugging convenience).
        ///     
        ///  1. A search graph is built, which simplifies the skill tree net in two
        ///     ways:
        ///         - All currently skilled nodes are contracted to a single
        ///           GraphNode.
        ///         - Any clusters that are adjacent to only one node (e.g. Fingers
        ///           of Frost) are omitted, unless they contain target or skilled
        ///           nodes.
        ///     Unless otherwise specified, "node" refers to GraphNode instances
        ///     from here on.
        ///     
        ///  2. Potential steiner nodes are determined. Only nodes with three or
        ///     more neighbors qualify for this.
        ///     In addition, nodes too far away from the start or target nodes also
        ///     do not qualify. The precise criteria for this are not exactly clear
        ///     yet, but the current approach seems to work.
        /// 
        /// Steps 1 and 2 greatly reduce the dimension of the search space, which
        /// enables an optimal (or near-optimal) solution to be found within quite
        /// short time.
        ///  
        ///  3. A genetic algorithm is employed to find the maximum of the fitness
        ///     function over the search space (see "Model and solution idea"). Its
        ///     inner workings won't be elaborated here, it is to note though that
        ///     scaling population size and maximum generation (as termination cri-
        ///     terium) linearly with the search space dimensions seems to ensure
        ///     finding optimal results, based on the tests so far.
        ///     Provided to the GA are only the search space dimension and the fit-
        ///     ness function, which will subsequently be discussed.
        ///     
        /// Fitness function:
        ///     In order to save computation time, not every bitstring (or DNA)
        ///     that the GA requests to be evaluated is converted back to an actual
        ///     skill tree. Instead, an MST on the steiner node set represented by
        ///     the DNA is built, based on the steiner node - steiner node distance
        ///     values (which are cached and thus inexpensive to access).
        ///     This introduces considerable ambiguity, to the point where DNAs
        ///     that would map to the same output skill tree can have substantially
        ///     different fitnesses, as well as (consequently) a DNA with a better
        ///     skill tree having worse fitness than a DNA with a worse skill tree.
        ///     A more detailed explanation is found in Example 1 below.
        ///     
        ///     However, the DNA with the global maximum fitness value will always
        ///     map to the best possible skill tree (as do many other DNAs with
        ///     near-optimal fitness). It is therefore imperative that the GA is
        ///     granted enough computational budget (and is robust enough) to find
        ///     the optimum, as the DNA with the best encountered fitness value
        ///     might not even correspond to the best skill tree when far away from
        ///     the optimum.
        ///     Since the claim of this solver is to actually provide optimal solu-
        ///     tions in as many cases as possible (anything that is "only close"
        ///     could easily be done by the user himself), while the fitness func-
        ///     tion is "nicely" shaped (since the skill tree is, well, quite
        ///     structured), trading usability outside the optimum for speed is a
        ///     reasonable approach.
        ///     
        ///     Obviously, the evaluation of the fitness function is the bottleneck
        ///     for the computation speed, so the use of a fast MST algorithm is
        ///     preferred. Refer to the MinimalSpanningTree class.
        /// 
        ///  4. The resulting high-fitness DNA is converted back to a steiner node
        ///     set, the target nodes and start node are added and the MST is built
        ///     (all of this is similarly part of the fitness function).
        ///     Since the result of the MST algorithm is a set of edges between
        ///     (graph) nodes, what is left is finding shortest paths for those
        ///     edges between the equivalent skill nodes of the graph nodes. These
        ///     paths are not cached and have to be computed anew for every conver-
        ///     sion from DNA -> graph MST -> skill tree.
        ///     
        /// Step 4 is performed after every generation of the GA (for giving the
        /// user visual feedback about the optimization progress), as well as after
        /// the termination of the GA optimization.
        /// The conversion back to the skill tree completes an optimization run.
        /// 
        ///
        /// Example 1: Necessity of steiner nodes
        /// Highlight Void Barrier and Coldhearted Calculation as a shadow without
        /// any skilled nodes.
        /// Observe how the optimal tree involves branching at a particular dex
        /// node, which will not be introduced by a greedy algorithm: The edges of
        /// the triangle formed by the two nodes and the shadow start all have dif-
        /// ferent lengths, and start - void barrier is the longest one. Taking the
        /// shortest path from start to Coldhearted Calculation and then taking the
        /// shortest path to Void Barrier results in a tree with 1 more point spent.
        /// 
        /// Example 2: Ambiguity/inaccuracy of the fitness function
        /// You start as Scion (no nodes skilled) and highlight Inner Force as well
        /// as Elemental Equilibrium and let the optimizer run. (All subsequently
        /// mentioned skill nodes will have a 1:1 equivalent as graph nodes, so no
        /// distinction will be made).
        /// Assume that a DNA (DNA1) corresponds to only using the Shaper node as
        /// steiner node. When building the MST, first the scion start will be con-
        /// nected to Shaper, then Shaper to EE, then Shaper to IF. These distances
        /// are then summed up for the weight of the MST, which counts the int node
        /// above Shaper twice (and thus overestimates the cost by 1 point).
        /// A different DNA (DNA2) that would correspond to the only steiner node
        /// being the middle mana node at scion start would similarly have its cost
        /// overestimated by three points, despite mapping to the very same (optimal)
        /// skill tree in the end.
        /// 
        /// It should be obvious from this that a non-optimal DNA can thus beat the
        /// fitness of an optimal, but "badly" represented tree/DNA: An otherwise
        /// optimal-fitness DNA (see below) could also include (for the sake of the
        /// example) the strength node below Shaper as a steiner node. It would thus
        /// have a fitness of 1 below optimal and, for the GA, would be considered
        /// superior to DNA2 which has a fitness of 2 points worse.
        /// 
        /// An optimal DNA would have the above-mentioned int node as steiner node.
        /// It can potentially have more steiner nodes on the path (which won't be
        /// real steiner nodes - it doesn't matter though since they don't affect
        /// the cost in the end), so more than one optimal DNA exists. Note how the
        /// sum of the MST edge lengths of this ideal DNA will always equal the
        /// amount of points that the corresponding skill tree actually needs, so
        /// it will always be a minimum cost (maximum fitness) solution, which the
        /// GA can eventually find.
        /// 
        /// In short: The fitness function will never overestimate the fitness of
        /// a given DNA. There exists a DNA that represents the optimal skill tree
        /// and is not overestimated (by virtue of having selected the steiner nodes
        /// that the optimal skill tree involves), so any DNA representing a non-
        /// optimal tree will necessarily have worse fitness values.
